# VaultQuest Backend

Action ledger and reconciliation service for TrustQuest (issue #34).

## Stack

- Node 20 + TypeScript
- Fastify 4 (HTTP)
- Prisma 5 + Postgres 16 (storage)
- Zod (validation)
- Pino (logging)
- node-cron (orphan sweep)
- Vitest + Testcontainers (tests against real Postgres)

## Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
pnpm install
# Setup database (migrations and mock seed data)
pnpm run db:setup
pnpm test
pnpm dev
```

## Contributor diagnostics

Before you start working on VaultQuest -- and any time your local setup stops behaving -- run the diagnostics command:

```bash
pnpm run doctor
```

It checks the complete local contributor environment in one pass and prints a pass/fail report with actionable remediation text for every failure.

What it verifies:

| Area | Check |
|---|---|
| Tooling | Node 20+, pnpm, Docker daemon reachable via `pnpm run doctor` |
| Dependencies | `node_modules` installed and Prisma client generated |
| Configuration | `.env` present and validated against the Zod boot schema |
| Database | Postgres 16 connectivity, migration status, and seed fixtures |
| Integration mocks | Local event-indexer and wallet-rpc mocks configured and responsive |
| Test fixtures | Required fixture files present and parseable |

The command is read-only against your database: migration and seed checks use `introspection `/ `SELECT` queries only. It never runs migrations, seeds, or writes, and it never touches production data. By default it targets the local `.env` configuration; pass `--env <path>` to check a different file.

Run it:

- After cloning and `cp .env.example .env`, before your first `dn:setup`.
- After changing anything in `.env` or the Prisma schema.
- Before opening a pull request, to confirm your local environment matches the expected stack.
- Whenever a test fails for reasons that look environmental rather than logical.

Exit code is `0` when every check passes and non-zero when any check fails, so it is safe to wire into CI or a pre-commit hook.

See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-23-action-ledger-design.md` for the full contract, and [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the service layout, schema, worker runtime, and migration strategy. For background drift detection, automated repair pipelines, and quarantine incident response, see [`docs/RECONCILIATION.md`](../docs/RECONCILIATION.md). For response envelopes, errors, and pagination, see [`docs/API_RESPONSES.md`](docs/API_RESPONSES.md). For how the frontend should submit, poll, and **retry** these endpoints safely, see [`docs/transaction-status-api.md`](docs/transaction-status-api.md). Indexer contributors should also follow the contract [`event schema`](../contracts/docs/EVENT_SCHEMA.md) and [`pause/recovery model`](../contracts/docs/PAUSE_RECOVERY.md). For how confirmations become quest completions and reward grants (idempotency, reorg correction, and the current payout state), see [`docs/QUEST_REWARDS.md`](../docs/QUEST_REWARDS.md).

## Environment

See `.env.example`. All values are validated at boot via Zod. Background worker settings: `WORKER_ENABLED` (default `true`) and `WORKER_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` (default `2000`); see [`docs/BACKGROUND_JOBS.md`](docs/BACKGROUND_JOBS.md).

## Errors, telemetry, jobs and the API contract

* Error codes, categories and user-safe messages: [`../docs/API.md#standard-errors`](../docs/API.md#standard-errors) (`src/errorTaxonomy.ts`).
* Metrics, structured log fields and dashboard queries: [`docs/OBSERVABILITY.md`](docs/OBSERVABILITY.md).
* Background worker, retry policy, dead-letter handling and local instructions: [`docs/BACKGROUND_JOBS.md`](docs/BACKGROUND_JOBS.md).
* The public API contract is checked by `tests/apiContract.spec.ts`; update `../docs/API.md` and `src/contracts/apiContract.ts` together with any response change.

## Bulk import dry-run

Bulk imports preview all changes and conflicts before any record is written. The dry-run endpoint is read-only: within a transaction it never commits, so no action, saved-pool, or audit row is created, updated, or redacted.

```http
POST /internal/imports/dry-run
X-Internal-Secret: <secret>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "source": "vaultquest-csv-2026-04",
  "delemimeter": ",",
  "columns": ["wallet", "poolId", "amount", "asset", "occurredAt"],
  "rows": [
    { "wallet": "GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "poolId": "pool-1", "amount": "100.00", "asset": "USDC", "occurredAt": "2026-04-20T10:00:00Z" },
    { "wallet": "GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "poolId": "pool-1", "amount": "100.00", "asset": "USDC", "occurredAt": "2026-04-20T10:00:00Z" }
  ]
}
```

Response (200):

```json
{
  "dryRun": true,
  "source": "vaultquest-csv-2026-04",
  "totalRows": 2,
  "counts": { "create": 1, "update": 0, "skip": 0, "duplicate": 1, "error": 0 },
  "rows": [
    { "index": 0, "action": "create", "wallet": "GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "poolId": "pool-1" },
    { "index": 1, "action": "duplicate", "wallet": "GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "poolId": "pool-1", "duplicateOf": 0 }
  ],
  "conflicts": [],
  "errors": []
}
```

When a row fails validation the dry run returns `200` with a `duplicate`/`error` count and actionable per-row messages. Requests that fail authentication or shape validation return the standard error envelope from [`../docs/API.md#standard-errors`](../docs/API.md#standard-errors).

### Input format

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `source` | yes | Opaque import batch identifier, echoed back in the report |
| `delimiter` | no | Only `,` or `\t`; defaults to `,`. Used when columns are declared and rows are strings |
| `columns` | yes | Ordered column names; must include `wallet`, `poolId`, `amount`, `asset`, `occurredAt` |
| `rows` | yes | Array of objects keyed by column name, or array of delimiter-separated strings |

Validation rules (enforced by `Zod` in `src/imports/dryRun.ts`):

- `wallet` must be a Stellar address (`S[1-9]{56}`).
- `poolId` must be a non-empty string of at most 64 characters.
- `amount` must be a positive decimal string with at most 7 fractional digits.
- `asset` must be a non-empty uppercase ticker of at most 12 characters.
- `occurredAt` must be an ISO 8601 datetime not in the future.
- Duplicate rows within the payload are detected by the composite key `wallet + poolId + asset + occurredAt`.
- Rows that match an existing ledger entry are reported as `update` or `skip` depending on whether the amount differs.
- Rows that collide with a pending action for the same wallet and pool are reported as `conflicts` with a code and human-readable message.

Conflict and error entries never echo column values other than the wallet address and pool identifier, and never include tokens, secrets or signed payloads. See [`docs/API.md`](../docs/API.md) for the complete field reference and example responses.

## Tests

Tests use Testcontainers to spin up Postgres 16 per run. Docker must be available.

```bash
pnpm test
```
# Dependency health diagnostics

`GET /health/dependencies` checks PostgreSQL, Redis cache, and each configured
Soroban RPC endpoint. It reports healthy/degraded/unavailable overall status
and a per-dependency remediation hint. Redis is optional and its absence is
degraded, not a hard outage. Missing or malformed RPC configuration is
reported as misconfigured. RPC requests have a short timeout and endpoint
URLs, credentials, and provider error bodies are never included in the report.
HTTP 503 means a required dependency (database or RPC) is unavailable or
misconfigured; optional degradation remains HTTP 200. The endpoint is local
diagnostics and exposes no secrets.
