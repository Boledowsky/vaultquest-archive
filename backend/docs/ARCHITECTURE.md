# Backend Service Architecture (#24)

This document is the foundation called out in issue #24: a documented
backend scaffold with explicit boundaries between the public API,
event-ingestion path, and worker runtime, plus the schema/migration story
that supports issues #13 and #14 without inventing a new platform later.

## Service boundaries

   └──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The three concerns are intentionally co-located in one repo but kept
in distinct modules so they can be split into separate processes (or
horizontally scaled independently) later without rewriting the data model:

- **API surface** — `src/routes/*` + `src/app.ts`. Pure Fastify handlers.
  Validates with Zod (`src/schemas/*`), delegates to `LedgerService`,
  serializes through a single `serialize()` helper for stable response
  shapes.
- **Indexing inbound** — `POST /internal/reconcile` is the *only* write
  path the event indexer (issue #13) touches. Authenticated by
  `X-Internal-Secret` (`AppDeps.internalSecret`). The handler delegates
  straight into `LedgerService.reconcileEvent`, which is replay-safe
  (event-first writes go to `PendingEvent` and are claimed when the
  intent eventually attaches its `tx_hash`).
- **Processed-event checkpointing** — the indexer also persists the last
  processed paging token alongside the ledger checkpoint, so a restart can
  resume from the next unread event instead of replaying an entire batch.
- **Worker runtime** — `src/cron.ts` schedules the reconciler sweep and
  the orphan TTL eviction. Worker concerns never reach into route
  handlers; they call `LedgerService` directly so they share the same
  invariants as the API.

## Domain model

| Table | Purpose | Key columns |
|---|---|---|
| `action_ledger` | Intent record. Created the moment a user clicks a button, before any tx is signed. | `idempotency_key` (unique), `wallet_address`, `action_type`, `status`, `tx_hash`, `correlation_id`, `error_code`, `redacted_at` |
| `pending_events` | Indexer-first events that arrived before the matching intent attached its `tx_hash`. Drained on attach. | `tx_hash` (PK), `soroban_event_id`, `event_payload`, `status_hint`, `consumed_at` |
| `indexer_checkpoints` | Singleton indexer cursor and health checkpoint. | `latest_ledger`, `last_processed_event_id`, `last_sync_time`, `last_success_sync_time`, `last_error` |

Status machine (enforced in `src/constants.ts`):

```
pending  ──┬──► submitted ──┬──► confirmed
           │                ├──► reverted
           │                └──► orphaned   (TTL sweep — worker)
           └──► failed
```

The ledger never deletes rows. Privacy scrub (`DELETE /actions?wallet=…`)
nulls `action_payload` and sets `redacted_at`, preserving the audit
trail for the indexer.

### Why an intent-first ledger

An intent is durably recorded *before* the wallet signs anything, so:

- A wallet timeout / browser refresh can recover by replaying the
  `Idempotency-Key` rather than producing a duplicate on-chain tx.
- The indexer can publish events asynchronously without coordinating
  with the API process.
- The `correlation_id` is carried through every log line and structured
  error response so the frontend can quote it in support tickets.

## Migration strategy

Schema lives in `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`. Migrations live in
`backend/prisma/migrations/` and are applied with the standard Prisma
flow — `prisma migrate dev` locally, `prisma migrate deploy` in CI and
production. Rollback is purposely *not* automated: every migration is
expected to be additive (new tables, new columns, new enum values).
Destructive changes require a paired migration that keeps the previous
schema readable until traffic has cut over.

## Local-development bootstrap

```bash
cp .env.example .env                  # set DATABASE_URL, INTERNAL_SECRET
pnpm install
pnpm exec prisma migrate deploy       # applies migrations to your local DB
pnpm dev                              # starts Fastify on $PORT, default 3000
pnpm test                             # vitest + testcontainers (needs Docker)
```

The default `.env.example` points at a local Postgres at
`localhost:5432`. Tests spin up an ephemeral Postgres 16 container per
run (`tests/helpers/db.ts`), so contributors don't need to manage a
test database manually.

## Configuration

All env vars are validated at boot in `src/env.ts` via Zod. Boot fails
loudly with a structured Zod error if anything is missing or malformed.
Required values:

| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres connection string. |
| `INTERNAL_SECRET` | Shared secret for `X-Internal-Secret` on `/internal/reconcile`. |
| `PORT` | HTTP port (optional, default 3000). |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Pino log level (`info`, `debug`, …). |

## Replay safety

`LedgerService.reconcileEvent` is the only path that writes a
confirmed/reverted status. It is wrapped in a Prisma transaction and
falls back to the `PendingEvent` table when the matching intent's
`tx_hash` has not yet been attached. The same transaction is invoked
from both the worker sweep and `POST /internal/reconcile`, so duplicate
deliveries from the indexer are idempotent.

## Smoke check

The repo ships a synchronous boot smoke test
(`tests/smoke.spec.ts`) that:

1. Boots the Fastify app with a Testcontainers Postgres instance
2. Applies the latest migrations via `prisma migrate deploy`
3. Asserts `/health` responds `200 { ok: true }`

Run it with `pnpm test -- smoke.spec.ts`. If this passes locally, the
backend stack is healthy enough for issues #13 and #14 to land work
against it.

## Release readiness checklist (high-risk changes)

High-risk changes to VaultQuest must pass a consistent release
checklist before merge. "High-risk" means any change that touches
vault accounting, prize draws, wallet flows, the intent ledger, the
indexer ingestion path, migrations, or production configuration.
When in doubt, treat the change as high-risk.

The canonical checklist lives in
`backend/docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` and is mirrored below so it is
discoverable from the architecture doc. A copy-pasteable template is
in `backend/docs/templates/RELEASE_CHECKLIST_TEMPLATE.md`; every
high-risk PR description must include the rendered template with all
boxes checked or explicitly waived.

### Required criteria

Every high-risk change must satisfy all five categories below. A PR
that cannot check a box must link to a maintainer-approved exception
(see *Exception handling* below) in the PR description.

1. **Tests**
   - `pnpm test` passes locally and in CI (vitest + testcontainers).
   - New behavior has unit coverage in `tests/` and, where the change
     crosses the API boundary, an integration test that boots the
     Fastify app against an ephemeral Postgres 16 container.
   - Vault accounting and prize-draw changes include a replay-safety
     test that exercises `LedgerService.reconcileEvent` with duplicate
     deliveries and asserts idempotent status transitions.
   - Wallet-flow changes include a test for the `Idempotency-Key`
     replay path (refresh / timeout recovery) and for the
     `correlation_id` propagation through structured error responses.
   - `pnpm test -- smoke.spec.ts` passes; the boot smoke test is the
     minimum bar for any backend change.

2. **Documentation**
   - `backend/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` is updated when service
     boundaries, the domain model, the status machine, or the
     migration story change.
   - Contributor-facing setup, env vars, or API contracts are updated
     in the same PR (no follow-up doc PRs for behavior changes).
   - User-dashboard or protocol-reporting changes note the
     `is_stale` semantics returned by `GET /dashboard/summary` and any
     impact on the frontend (#7, #14).

3. **Migration**
   - Migrations are additive (new tables, new columns, new enum
     values). Destructive changes ship a paired migration that keeps
     the previous schema readable until traffic has cut over.
   - `pnpm exec prisma migrate deploy` has been run against a fresh
     database and against a copy of the current production schema.
   - The migration is reversible by rolling back the deploy and
     re-running the previous release; if it is not, the PR documents
     the forward-only plan and the maintainer sign-off.

4. **Config**
   - Any new env var is added to `src/env.ts` with a Zod schema, to
     `.env.example`, and to the configuration table in this document.
   - Boot fails loudly with a structured Zod error when a required
     value is missing or malformed; the PR includes the failure
     output.
   - Secret rotation or `INTERNAL_SECRET` changes are called out in
     the PR description with the deployment steps.

5. **Rollback**
   - The PR describes how to roll back: revert the deploy, re-run the
     previous release, and (if applicable) run the paired migration.
   - Rollback has been exercised in a staging or ephemeral
     environment, or the PR explains why it cannot be and what the
     manual procedure is.
   - Data written by the new code is readable by the previous
     release, or the PR documents the forward-only constraint.

### Automated validation

Where practical, the checklist is enforced by tooling rather than by
reviewer memory:

- `pnpm release:check` runs the local validation command. It executes
  `pnpm test`, `pnpm exec prisma migrate deploy` against a throwaway
  database, and a schema-drift check that fails if
  `prisma/schema.prisma` and `prisma/migrations/` disagree.
- CI runs `pnpm release:check` on every PR that touches
  `backend/src/**`, `backend/prisma/**`, or `backend/docs/**`.
- The PR template (`.github/pull_request_template.md`) requires the
  rendered checklist and blocks merge until every box is checked or
  an exception link is present.

If `pnpm release:check` cannot run in a contributor's environment
(for example, Docker is unavailable), the PR must paste the CI run
URL that executed it.

### Exception handling for urgent fixes

Urgent fixes (production incidents, security patches, or
time-critical protocol reporting corrections) may bypass individual
checklist items with explicit maintainer sign-off:

1. Open the PR with the rendered checklist and mark each waived item
   with `WAIVED:` followed by the reason and the incident link.
2. Request review from at least one maintainer listed in
   `CODEOWNERS`. A single maintainer approval is sufficient for a
   waiver; two are required if the waiver covers **Migration** or
   **Rollback**.
3. The maintainer records the sign-off in the PR description with
   their GitHub handle and the timestamp.
4. A follow-up issue is filed within 24 hours to complete the waived
   items. The follow-up is linked from the original PR and is
   prioritized in the next release.

Waivers are never silent. A high-risk change merged without a
completed checklist and without a recorded waiver is treated as a
release blocker and must be reverted.

### Maintainer sign-off expectations

- Maintainers are the only reviewers who can approve a waiver or
  sign off on a forward-only migration.
- Sign-off means the maintainer has read the checklist, verified the
  test output and CI run, and accepts responsibility for the
  rollback plan.
- Maintainers must not approve their own high-risk PRs; a second
  maintainer is required for any change touching vault accounting,
  prize draws, or the intent ledger.
- Sign-off is recorded in the PR description, not only in the review
  UI, so the audit trail survives branch deletion.

## Relationship to the rest of the system

- **Frontend (#7, #14)** consumes only the public Fastify routes.
  Stale-data handling is driven by the `is_stale` flag returned from
  `GET /dashboard/summary`.
- **Soroban contracts (#10, #11, #12)** never call this service
  directly. Their events flow through the off-chain indexer (issue #13)
  and arrive here via `POST /internal/reconcile`.
- **Indexer (#13)** is the only producer of `PendingEvent` rows and the
  only authenticated caller of `/internal/reconcile`.
