/**
 * Disaster-recovery classification of every stored table (#754).
 *
 * Keyed by `Prisma.ModelName`, so adding a model to schema.prisma without
 * classifying it here is a compile error — the recovery runbook
 * (docs/DISASTER_RECOVERY.md) cannot silently fall behind the schema.
 *
 *  - chain-derived: fully rebuilt from on-chain history by replaying the
 *    chain event log; safe to truncate and rebuild.
 *  - mixed: off-chain rows whose chain-derived columns are reset and then
 *    rebuilt by replay (the off-chain part must come from backup).
 *  - off-chain: exists only in this database; lost without a backup.
 *  - ephemeral: operational state that must be dropped on recovery.
