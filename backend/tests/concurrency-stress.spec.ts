/**
 * Concurrency stress tests (#790).
 *
 * These tests prove that the critical mutation paths in VaultQuest
 * preserve their domain invariants when accessed concurrently. They
 * cover the four shapes of race the acceptance criteria call out:
 *
 *  1. Simultaneous success - N writers arrive at once and all must
 *     land without duplicating a record.
 *  2. Conflicting requests - two writers claim the same exclusive
 *     resource and exactly one must win.
 *  3. Duplicate retries - the same logical operation is replayed and
 *     must be idlempotent.
 *  4. Timeout behavior - an operation that loses its lease must not
 *     commit a stale write.
 *
 * The tests use the in-memory stores that the services already expose
 * (see tests/invariants.spec.ts) so they exercise the same logic the
 * production Prisma backend uses. The deterministic clock and barrier
 * primitives in ./helpers/concurrency make the interleavings reproducible
 * rather than dependent on scheduler jitter.
